Askbot
======

Askbot in OpenMOOC works a bit different than usual. As a start, you must install
the regular askbot in your system:

.. code-block:: txt

    # yum install askbot

After that you must install the OpenMOOC components for Askbot, like this:

.. code-block:: txt

    # yum install openmooc-askbot

This will install the OpenMOOC modifications to askbot and the OpenMOOC theme for
Askbot.
