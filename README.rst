OpenMOOC
========

OpenMOOC is an open source platform (Apache license 2.0) that implements a
fully open MOOC solution. If you do not know what a MOOC is,
`check it out on Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course>`_.


How it works
============

* **Video+Internet**. Combined use of video and intelligent discussion forums.
  The content is available online from a desktop, tablet or smartphone.
* **Progressive**. The courses consist of units built by a set of knowledge
  pills. Pills are short videos that can be associated with supplementary material
  (documents, links, exercises) and questions with their respective answers. Pills
  are classified in normal, homework and exams. The difference between them is the
  time to study them and the possibility or not to see the answers before the
  deadline of the pill.
* **Participative**. Each course has associated an intelligent discuission forum
  where students and teachers can discuss and collaborate on a unit/knowledge
  pill.


Architecture
============

OpenMOOC is a platform based on several components:

* **Identity provider**. This component is responsible on the identity of the
  users. This includes: user registration, user management data and Single Sign On
  (SSO). It's based on SimpleSAMLphp and modules for it like the userregistration
  and a custom template.
* **Moocng**. This is the platform's engine. This module allows teachers to
  create, manage and release courses and students to apply and follow them. It's
  written in Python/Django.
* **Askbot**. This component is a Q&A platform written in Python/Django. At
  present time it's the main way of communication between teachers and students.


Main features
=============

* 100% open source solution
* Video integration with documents and teacherâ€™s remarks
* Extremely simple course creation interface
* Self assessment progress
* Social discussion forum
* Follow up own/others' questions
* No need to stream videos from a local platform (uses YouTube)
* WYSIWYG interface for content creation
* Medals (badges) for assessing your social behavior in the forum
* Federation of identities based on standard (SAML2)


First contact through an appliance
==================================

There is one virtual appliance published, very useful to get the system
running quickly or to run a demo in your own machine.
